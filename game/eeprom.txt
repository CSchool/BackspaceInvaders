SECTOR = 12 BYTES

FIRST 4 BYTES:
    0xfc

    <addr of first entry>

SECTOR x OCCUPIES BYTES [4 + 12x; 15 + 12x]

SECTOR 0:
    just a bit map of occupied sectors (0 - free, 1 - occupied)
    (read(4 + (SECTOR >> 3)) >> (SECTOR & 7)) & 1

ENTRY:
    unsigned char name[10]
    uint8_t data
    uint8_t next

DATA:
    uint8_t bytes[11]
